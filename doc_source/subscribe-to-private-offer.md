# Private products and offers<a name="subscribe-to-private-offer"></a>

Data providers can provide a product to you that isn't available to the general public, or they can offer their product at terms that are different from the publicly available oﬀer terms\. A private oﬀer can be different from the public oﬀer in any dimension, including price, duration, payment schedule, data subscription agreement, or refund policy\. 

**Note**  
Unlike Bring Your Own Subscription \(BYOS\) offers, private offers are not required to be based on an existing subscription that predates the product's availability on AWS Data Exchange\.

The provider must create a custom offer for your AWS account ID to target the offer to you\. If a private offer hasn't been extended to you, you can request one by contacting a provider using the contact information on the details page of the public offer\.

As a subscriber, you can accept a private offer as follows\.

**To accept a private offer**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Data Exchange console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, from **Discover data products**, choose **My product offers**\.

1. Find the product offer you are looking for in the list\. You can filter at the top of the page to choose between **All products**, **Private products**, or **Public products**\.

1. Select the offer to which you want to subscribe\.

1. Choose **Continue to subscribe**\.

1. Review the terms of the offer, the payment schedule, the data subscription agreement, and the included data sets\.
**Note**  
To accept a private offer with a multiple payment schedule, you must be on invoice billing terms\. You can [create a support ticket](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) if you want to switch to invoice billing terms\.  
Private offers with a multiple payment schedule are not eligible for automatic renewal\.

1. If you accept the terms of the offer, review and accept the acknowledgement, and then choose **Subscribe**\.
**Note**  
Your account is automatically invoiced according to the dates specified in the payment schedule\.
