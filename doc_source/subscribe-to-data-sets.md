# Subscribing to data products on AWS Data Exchange<a name="subscribe-to-data-sets"></a>

At a high level, this is how to subscribe to data products using AWS Data Exchange:

1. **Potential subscriber registers on AWS** – You must sign up for AWS and create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user before you can use AWS Data Exchange\. For more information, see [Setting up AWS Data Exchange](setting-up.md)\.

1. **Potential subscriber browses the catalog** – Products are published on AWS Data Exchange and are also available on AWS Marketplace\. You can find products and review the associated public or custom offers and product details\. If the provider has issued a private offer to your account, the product is available on the **My product offers** page of the AWS Data Exchange console\. 

1. **\(Optional\) Potential subscriber submits a request for a subscription** – The provider can choose to enable subscription verification\. If they do so, you must request a subscription to the product\. For more information, see [Subscription verification for subscribers](subscription-verification-sub.md)\.

1. **Subscriber subscribes to the product** – If you subscribe to a paid product, you are billed on your AWS bill\. You get access to the entitled data set\. 

1. **Subscriber uses the product** – You have access to the product data sets according to the terms of the data subscription agreement\. You can export the associated assets to Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) or you can use jobs with a signed URL\. For more information, see [Jobs in AWS Data Exchange](jobs.md)\.

1. **Request a data product recommendation** – If you are not able to find a product in the catalog, you can use the **Request data product page** in the AWS Data Exchange console to request personalized recommendations from the AWS Data Exchange Data Discovery Team\.

**Note**  
When subscribing to data products from some non\-US sellers, you might also receive a tax invoice from the seller\. For more information, see [Tax Help \- AWS Marketplace Sellers](http://aws.amazon.com/tax-help/marketplace/)\.
