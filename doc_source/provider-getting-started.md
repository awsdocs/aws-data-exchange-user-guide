**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Confirm your eligibility](#provider-prereqs)
+ [Step 2: Register to be a provider](#provider-registration)
+ [Step 3: Confirm eligibility of your data](#confirm-data-eligibility)

## Step 1: Confirm your eligibility<a name="provider-prereqs"></a>

Before you can register, you must meet the following requirements to confirm your eligibility\.

### Requirements for publishing data products<a name="seller-requirements-for-publishing-free-products"></a>

 Whether you charge for your AWS Data Exchange data product, you're selling that product on AWS Marketplace\. To create and offer data products, you must: 
+ Have a defined customer support process and support organization\. 
+ Provide a means to keep data regularly updated and free of vulnerabilities\.
+ Follow best practices and guidelines when marketing your product\.
+ Be an AWS customer in good standing and meet the requirements in the terms and conditions for AWS Marketplace sellers and for AWS Data Exchange providers\.
+ Be a permanent resident or citizen in an [eligible jurisdiction](#eligible-jurisdictions), or a business entity organized or incorporated in one of those areas\.
+ To provide data products, you must also request on\-boarding through the [Create case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases?#/create?issueType=customer-service) wizard for AWS Support\. The AWS Data Exchange team will contact you to complete the qualification and registration process\.

Additionally, if you want to offer products and charge for them, you must provide the following information:
+ You must provide tax and bank account information\. For US\-based entities, a W\-9 form and a banking account from a US\-based bank are required\.
+ Non\-US sellers are required to provide a W\-8 form, value\-added tax \(VAT\) or goods and services tax \(GST\) registration number, and US bank information\. If you don't have a US bank account, you can register for a virtual US bank account from [Hyperwallet](https://wssellers.hyperwallet.com/)\.

For more information about VAT, invoicing, and your tax obligations as a provider, see [AWS Marketplace Sellers](https://aws.amazon.com/tax-help/marketplace/) on [Amazon Web Service Tax Help](https://aws.amazon.com/tax-help/)\.

## Step 2: Register to be a provider<a name="provider-registration"></a>

To use AWS Data Exchange as a provider, you must be a registered seller on AWS Marketplace and be qualified by the AWS Data Exchange team\. When you register an account as an AWS Marketplace seller, the account is the seller of record for your products and is used for reporting and disbursement\. All products and their public offers are discoverable on AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace\.

**Important**  
You can't change the AWS account that you use to list a product on AWS Marketplace\. Only data sets owned by that account can be included in products published by that account\. Only AWS accounts that are registered to provide data products on AWS Marketplace and AWS Data Exchange can publish products\.

**To register as a provider for AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace**

1. From your web browser, open the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/)\.

1. Choose **Sign Up as a Seller** to open the registration wizard\.

1. Confirm your company or full name, and review the Terms and Conditions\. If you agree to them, choose **I have read and agree to these terms**\.

1. On the **Account Settings** page, choose **Add** to add a public profile\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want to submit paid products to AWS Marketplace or AWS Data Exchange, you must provide your tax and banking information\. On the **Account Settings** page, from the **Provide tax and banking information** tab, choose **Start** to complete the tax and banking wizard\. This submits your tax and banking information in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. 
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you sign and submit the tax form electronically\. Otherwise, you must print, complete the signature section, and mail a hard copy of the tax form to the address provided in the tax information interview\. This delays the registration process\.

1. In addition to being a registered AWS Marketplace seller, you must submit an AWS Data Exchange qualification request\. Access the [AWS Support Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases#/create?issueType=customer-service) and create a case in the AWS Management Console\. The AWS Data Exchange team will contact you to complete the qualification and registration process\.

## Step 3: Confirm eligibility of your data<a name="confirm-data-eligibility"></a>

To confirm the eligibility of your data, review the [Publishing guidelines](publishing-guidelines.md)\.

If you have questions about the eligibility of your data set, you can take any of the following actions:
+ Contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=customer-service)\. 
+ Send an email message to [dataexchangehelp@amazon\.com](mailto://dataexchangehelp@amazon.com)\.
+ Access the [AWS Support Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=customer-service) and create a case in the AWS Management Console\.

You can create your product after you've reviewed the publishing guidelines for data products on AWS Data Exchange, and you've conﬁrmed that your data set can be listed\.
