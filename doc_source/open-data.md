+ [https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/the-cloud/asdi](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/the-cloud/asdi) – This AWS program minimizes the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets\.

Anyone can search and find these free Open Data on AWS data sets, with or without an AWS account, no subscription required\.

Anyone can analyze and build services on top of an Open Data data set by using compute and data analytics services including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Athena, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EMR\.
